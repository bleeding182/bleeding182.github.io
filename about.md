First, a disclaimer.

This is my personal blog. It does not necessarily depict the opinion of my employer, or any other linked sources.

Now, let's continue.

## Myself

Hey, thanks for reading this. I'm from Austria, Europe and I have been developing Android apps since 2014. I care a lot about unique and creative solutions. By looking for new ways to accomplish things I believe that you can learn a lot in the process.

Please feel free to contact me if you have some feedback, comment, or criticism about my work or findings, I am well aware that I do make mistakes and am happy to learn about them!

Have a nice day and enjoy my blog!
